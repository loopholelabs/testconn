Testing is a [Go](http://golang.org) library that holds many helper packages for testing various [Golang](http://golang.org) programs. 

**This library requires Go 1.17 or later.**

## Important note about releases and stability

This repository generally follows [Semantic
Versioning](https://semver.org/). However, **this library is currently in Alpha** and
is still considered experimental. Breaking changes of the library will _not_ trigger a
new major release. The same is true for selected other new features explicitly marked as
**EXPERIMENTAL** in CHANGELOG.md.
